# Selectim

Selectim as a company is now defunct, but here are some samples of code I wrote there (all self-taught, prior to attending General Assembly's web development immersive - where I learned more modern Javascript techniques and how better to structure my code.)

Shown here are the main Javascript file I wrote for UI navigation, built mostly with jQuery, the PHP backend I wrote to serve the search input's autocomplete dialogue, and some PHP written to manage interactions with Paypal's API.
